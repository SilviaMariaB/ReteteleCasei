# ReteteleCasei
In this project, students are expected to build a website using the Express/Node.js platform, with the Axios HTTP client, that integrates a chosen public API from the given list or their own API. The website should interact with the chosen API, retrieve data, and present it in a user-friendly manner.

Objectives
Develop an understanding of how to integrate public/own APIs into web projects.

Gain practical experience using Express/Node.js for server-side programming.

Enhance understanding of client-server communication using Axios.

Demonstrate ability to manipulate, present, and work with data retrieved from APIs.

The look is similar to the blog API project. We have the home page where we have all the recepies displayed:
